# Business Intelligence Reporting (BIR) Process

## Overview

This repository provides documentation for a generic Business Intelligence Reporting process. This process outlines a series of steps to define and implement a business intelligence system, applicable to a wide range of organizations.

## 1. Identify Stakeholders

- Compile a list of key stakeholders across different departments, ensuring representation from executives, managers, analysts, and end-users.
- Conduct stakeholder interviews or workshops to gather insights into their specific needs and expectations from the BI system.
- Identify any external stakeholders, such as clients, partners, or regulatory bodies, who may have an interest in the BI outcomes.
- **Example:**
    - Stakeholders include executives (e.g., CEO, CFO), managers (e.g., sales manager), analysts, and end-users from various departments.
    - Conduct stakeholder interviews to understand their needs, e.g., the sales manager needs sales performance insights.

## 2. Define Business Goals and Objectives

- Clearly define short-term and long-term business goals that the BI system should contribute to, such as revenue growth, cost reduction, or market expansion.
- Align objectives with the organization's strategic vision and ensure they are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).
- Prioritize goals to focus on the most critical aspects of the business.
- **Example:**
    - Business goal: Increase revenue by 15% in the next fiscal year.
    - Objective: Improve sales forecasting accuracy to support revenue growth.

## 3. Conduct a Business Assessment

- Evaluate existing business processes to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas where BI can drive improvements.
- Assess the current state of data governance, data quality, and data integration to identify potential challenges.
- Review the existing BI landscape, including tools and technologies in use, to understand integration points.
- **Example:**
    - Identify inefficiencies in the order fulfillment process and bottlenecks in the supply chain.
    - Evaluate the current BI landscape, noting challenges such as data silos.


## 4. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and define key metrics that directly align with business goals.
- Ensure that KPIs are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Establish a KPI hierarchy, distinguishing between strategic, tactical, and operational metrics.
- **Example:**
    - KPI: Monthly sales growth rate.
    - Ensure the KPI is measurable, e.g., achieve a 10% monthly sales growth rate.

## 5. Determine Data Sources

- Compile a comprehensive list of internal and external data sources that contribute to the BI requirements.
- Evaluate the accessibility and quality of each data source to ensure it meets the standards required for effective analysis.

    - Data quality issue: Incomplete customer records in the CRM system.
    - Implement a data cleansing process to address these issues.

    ### 7.1. Data Transformation
    
 - **Data Validation**: Implement thorough data validation processes to identify and handle any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the dataset. This involves performing data quality checks, verifying data integrity, and addressing any discrepancies before visualizing the data.
  - **Data Cleansing**: Cleanse the data by removing outliers, duplicates, or irrelevant data points. Apply data transformation techniques such as normalization, standardization, or imputation to handle missing values or inconsistent formats. By ensuring data cleanliness, we can prevent inaccurate visual representations and misleading insights.
  - **Explanation:** Cleanse and transform raw data into a standardized and usable format. Ensure data consistency and accuracy.

      **Example:** Standardize date formats, handle missing values, and convert currencies to a common unit.

  ### 7.2. Data Integration

    **Explanation:** Integrate data from various sources to create a unified dataset. Merge and consolidate data to provide a comprehensive view.

     **Example:** Combine customer data from the CRM with sales data from the ERP to create a consolidated customer profile.

## 8. Define User Roles and Responsibilities

- Clearly define user roles such as executives, analysts, and operational staff, outlining their responsibilities within the BI system.
- Determine access levels and permissions based on user roles to ensure data security and privacy.
- Establish a feedback loop for users to provide insights on system usability and functionality.
- **Example:**
    - Analysts responsible for creating reports and executives for decision-making.
    - Assign permissions based on roles to ensure data security.

## 9. Create a Data Governance Plan

- Develop data governance policies covering data security, privacy, compliance, and ethical use.
- Assign roles and responsibilities for data stewardship, data ownership, and data custodianship.
- Implement procedures for data classification, access control, and audit trails to maintain data integrity.
- **Example:**
    - Data governance policy: Data access restricted to authorized personnel.
    - Data stewardship: Assign data stewards to ensure data quality.

## 10. Design Information Delivery

- Choose appropriate visualization techniques for different types of data and audiences.
- Determine the frequency and format of information delivery, considering scheduled reports, real-time dashboards, and ad-hoc queries.
- Design user-friendly interfaces to facilitate easy interpretation and interaction with BI insights.
- **Example:**
    - Visualization technique: Bar charts for sales performance.
    - Information delivery: Real-time dashboards for immediate insights.

## 11. Select BI Tools and Technologies
