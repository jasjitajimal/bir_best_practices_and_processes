Creating a Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) process involves several steps to ensure that the business intelligence system meets the organization's needs. Below is a generalized start-to-end process for defining Business Intelligence requirements:

Identify Stakeholders:

Identify and involve key stakeholders such as executives, managers, analysts, and end-users who will be using the business intelligence system.
Define Business Goals and Objectives:

Clearly articulate the overall business goals and objectives that the BI system is expected to support. This could include improving decision-making, increasing efficiency, or identifying new business opportunities.
Conduct a Business Assessment:

Evaluate the current state of the business processes, data infrastructure, and existing BI tools. Identify pain points, challenges, and opportunities for improvement.
Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Define the key metrics and performance indicators that align with the business goals. These KPIs will guide the development of reports and dashboards.
Determine Data Sources:

Identify and document the data sources required to support the KPIs and business objectives. This includes internal databases, external sources, and any other relevant data repositories.
Assess Data Quality:

Evaluate the quality of the available data, including accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. Address any data quality issues that may impact the effectiveness of the BI system.
Define User Roles and Responsibilities:

Specify the different user roles within the organization and their responsibilities in relation to the BI system. This includes defining who will create reports, analyze data, and make decisions based on the BI insights.
Create a Data Governance Plan:

Establish data governance policies to ensure data security, privacy, and compliance. Define roles and responsibilities for data stewardship and data ownership.
Design Information Delivery:

Determine the best methods for delivering information to end-users, such as reports, dashboards, alerts, and ad-hoc queries. Consider the format and frequency of information delivery.
Select BI Tools and Technologies:

Choose the appropriate BI tools and technologies based on the requirements gathered. Consider factors such as scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost.
Develop Prototypes:

Create prototypes or mockups of reports and dashboards to gather feedback from stakeholders. Iteratively refine the prototypes based on user input.
Implement BI Solution:

Develop and deploy the BI solution based on the finalized requirements. Ensure that the system integrates seamlessly with existing business processes and data infrastructure.
User Training and Adoption:

Provide training to end-users on how to use the BI system effectively. Encourage user adoption by demonstrating the value and benefits of the BI solution.
Monitor and Evaluate:

Continuously monitor the performance of the BI system and gather user feedback. Evaluate the effectiveness of the BI solution in meeting business objectives.
Iterate and Improve:

Based on feedback and evolving business needs, iterate on the BI system to incorporate improvements, new features, and address any emerging requirements.
By following this start-to-end process, organizations can develop a robust Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) framework that aligns with their business goals and enables informed decision-making.
