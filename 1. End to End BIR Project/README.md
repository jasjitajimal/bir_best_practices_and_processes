# Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) Process

## Overview


This repository provides documentation for a generic Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) process. The BIR process outlines a series of steps to define and implement a business intelligence system, applicable to a wide range of organizations.

## 1. Identify Stakeholders

Identify and involve key stakeholders from various departments, including executives, managers, analysts, and end-users. Consider individuals who will play a role in decision-making and utilizing business intelligence insights.

## 2. Define Business Goals and Objectives

Clearly articulate the overarching business goals and objectives that the BI system aims to support. This could include improving decision-making, optimizing operational efficiency, or gaining a competitive advantage.

## 3. Conduct a Business Assessment

Evaluate the current state of business processes, data infrastructure, and existing BI tools. Identify challenges and opportunities for improvement that the BI system can address.

## 4. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Define the key metrics and performance indicators aligned with business goals. These KPIs will serve as benchmarks to measure the success of the BI system.

## 5. Determine Data Sources

Identify and document the various data sources required to support the defined KPIs. This encompasses both internal and external data repositories.

## 6. Assess Data Quality

Evaluate the quality of available data, addressing issues related to accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. Ensure that high-quality data underpins the effectiveness of the BI system.

## 7. Define User Roles and Responsibilities

Specify the different user roles within the organization and their responsibilities concerning the BI system. This includes report creation, data analysis, and decision-making.

## 8. Create a Data Governance Plan

Establish data governance policies to ensure data security, privacy, and compliance. Define roles and responsibilities for data stewardship and ownership.

## 9. Design Information Delivery

Determine the best methods for delivering information to end-users, such as reports, dashboards, alerts, and ad-hoc queries. Consider the format and frequency of information delivery.

## 10. Select BI Tools and Technologies

Choose BI tools and technologies based on organizational requirements, considering factors like scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost.

## 11. Develop Prototypes

Create prototypes or mockups of reports and dashboards to gather feedback from stakeholders. Iteratively refine the prototypes based on user input.

## 12. Implement BI Solution

Develop and deploy the BI solution based on the finalized requirements, ensuring seamless integration with existing business processes and data infrastructure.

## 13. User Training and Adoption

Provide training to end-users on effectively utilizing the BI system. Encourage user adoption by demonstrating the value and benefits of the BI solution.

## 14. Monitor and Evaluate

Continuously monitor the performance of the BI system and gather user feedback. Evaluate the effectiveness of the BI solution in meeting business objectives.
