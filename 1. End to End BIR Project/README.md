# Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) Process

## Overview

This repository provides documentation for a generic Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) process. The BIR process outlines a series of steps to define and implement a business intelligence system, applicable to a wide range of organizations.

## 1. Identify Stakeholders

- Compile a list of key stakeholders across different departments, ensuring representation from executives, managers, analysts, and end-users.
- Conduct stakeholder interviews or workshops to gather insights into their specific needs and expectations from the BI system.
- Identify any external stakeholders, such as clients, partners, or regulatory bodies, who may have an interest in the BI outcomes.
- **Example:**
    - Stakeholders include executives (e.g., CEO, CFO), managers (e.g., sales manager), analysts, and end-users from various departments.
    - Conduct stakeholder interviews to understand their needs, e.g., the sales manager needs sales performance insights.

## 2. Define Business Goals and Objectives

- Clearly define short-term and long-term business goals that the BI system should contribute to, such as revenue growth, cost reduction, or market expansion.
- Align objectives with the organization's strategic vision and ensure they are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Prioritize goals to focus on the most critical aspects of the business.
- **Example:**
    - Business goal: Increase revenue by 15% in the next fiscal year.
    - Objective: Improve sales forecasting accuracy to support revenue growth.

## 3. Conduct a Business Assessment

- Evaluate existing business processes to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas where BI can drive improvements.
- Assess the current state of data governance, data quality, and data integration to identify potential challenges.
- Review the existing BI landscape, including tools and technologies in use, to understand integration points.
- **Example:**
    - Identify inefficiencies in the order fulfillment process and bottlenecks in the supply chain.
    - Evaluate the current BI landscape, noting challenges such as data silos.

## 4. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and define key metrics that directly align with business goals.
- Ensure that KPIs are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Establish a KPI hierarchy, distinguishing between strategic, tactical, and operational metrics.
- **Example:**
    - KPI: Monthly sales growth rate.
    - Ensure the KPI is measurable, e.g., achieve a 10% monthly sales growth rate.

## 5. Determine Data Sources

- Compile a comprehensive list of internal and external data sources that contribute to the BI requirements.
- Evaluate the accessibility and quality of each data source to ensure it meets the standards required for effective analysis.
- Consider the integration of structured and unstructured data for a holistic view.
- **Example:**
    - Internal sources: CRM system, ERP system.
    - External sources: Market data from industry reports.

## 6. Assess Data Quality

- Implement a data profiling process to assess the quality of data, identifying issues related to accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.
- Develop a strategy for data cleansing and transformation to address any identified quality issues.
- Establish ongoing data quality monitoring practices to maintain high standards.
- **Example:**
    - Data quality issue: Incomplete customer records in the CRM system.
    - Implement a data cleansing process to address these issues.

## 7. Define User Roles and Responsibilities

- Clearly define user roles such as executives, analysts, and operational staff, outlining their responsibilities within the BI system.
- Determine access levels and permissions based on user roles to ensure data security and privacy.
- Establish a feedback loop for users to provide insights on system usability and functionality.
- **Example:**
    - Analysts responsible for creating reports and executives for decision-making.
    - Assign permissions based on roles to ensure data security.

## 8. Create a Data Governance Plan

- Develop data governance policies covering data security, privacy, compliance, and ethical use.
- Assign roles and responsibilities for data stewardship, data ownership, and data custodianship.
- Implement procedures for data classification, access control, and audit trails to maintain data integrity.
- **Example:**
    - Data governance policy: Data access restricted to authorized personnel.
    - Data stewardship: Assign data stewards to ensure data quality.

## 9. Design Information Delivery

- Choose appropriate visualization techniques for different types of data and audiences.
- Determine the frequency and format of information delivery, considering scheduled reports, real-time dashboards, and ad-hoc queries.
- Design user-friendly interfaces to facilitate easy interpretation and interaction with BI insights.
- **Example:**
    - Visualization technique: Bar charts for sales performance.
    - Information delivery: Real-time dashboards for immediate insights.

## 10. Select BI Tools and Technologies

- Evaluate BI tools and technologies based on factors such as scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost.
- Consider the compatibility of selected tools with existing infrastructure and technologies.
- Ensure that the chosen tools support the required analytics and reporting features.
- **Example:**
    - Tool: Tableau for its user-friendly interface and robust visualization capabilities.
    - Consider compatibility with existing tools like the CRM system.

## 11. Develop Prototypes

- Create interactive prototypes of reports and dashboards to gather user feedback early in the development process.
- Iteratively refine prototypes based on stakeholder input, ensuring alignment with user expectations.
- Use prototyping as a tool for validating data visualizations and user workflows.
- **Example:**
    - Prototype: Interactive dashboard showcasing key sales metrics.
    - Gather feedback to refine the dashboard's design and functionality.

## 12. Implement BI Solution

- Develop the BI solution based on the finalized requirements, adhering to best practices in coding and development.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any bugs or issues.
- Collaborate with IT and relevant departments for a seamless integration process.
- **Example:**
    - Develop the BI solution using Python for backend analytics and integration.
    - Test the solution thoroughly to ensure data accuracy and system stability.

## 13. User Training and Adoption

## Overall Example Explanation:
Suppose we're implementing a BI system for a fictional company "ABC Sales Inc." aiming to boost revenue. After identifying stakeholders like the CEO, CFO, and sales manager, we set a business goal to increase revenue by 15%. Conducting a business assessment, we identify supply chain bottlenecks. Key metrics (KPIs) are established, such as the monthly sales growth rate. Internal sources like the CRM system and external sources like market reports are deemed essential. Data quality assessment reveals incomplete customer records, addressed through a data cleansing process. Roles are defined, with analysts creating reports and executives making decisions. A data governance plan ensures secure and ethical data use. Visualization techniques like bar charts are chosen for sales performance, delivered through real-time dashboards using tools like Tableau. Prototypes are developed, and the BI solution is implemented using Python, with regular monitoring of metrics like dashboard load times. User training programs and incentives encourage adoption, and the system undergoes iterative improvements based on user feedback and changing business needs.
