# Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) Process

## Overview

This repository provides documentation for a generic Business Intelligence Requirement (BIR) process. The BIR process outlines a series of steps to define and implement a business intelligence system, applicable to a wide range of organizations.

## 1. Identify Stakeholders

- Compile a list of key stakeholders across different departments, ensuring representation from executives, managers, analysts, and end-users.
- Conduct stakeholder interviews or workshops to gather insights into their specific needs and expectations from the BI system.
- Identify any external stakeholders, such as clients, partners, or regulatory bodies, who may have an interest in the BI outcomes.
- **Example:**
    - Stakeholders include executives (e.g., CEO, CFO), managers (e.g., sales manager), analysts, and end-users from various departments.
    - Conduct stakeholder interviews to understand their needs, e.g., the sales manager needs sales performance insights.

## 2. Define Business Goals and Objectives

- Clearly define short-term and long-term business goals that the BI system should contribute to, such as revenue growth, cost reduction, or market expansion.
- Align objectives with the organization's strategic vision and ensure they are measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Prioritize goals to focus on the most critical aspects of the business.
- **Example:**
    - Business goal: Increase revenue by 15% in the next fiscal year.
    - Objective: Improve sales forecasting accuracy to support revenue growth.

## 3. Conduct a Business Assessment

- Evaluate existing business processes to identify inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and areas where BI can drive improvements.
- Assess the current state of data governance, data quality, and data integration to identify potential challenges.
- Review the existing BI landscape, including tools and technologies in use, to understand integration points.
- **Example:**
    - Identify inefficiencies in the order fulfillment process and bottlenecks in the supply chain.
    - Evaluate the current BI landscape, noting challenges such as data silos.

## 4. Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Collaborate with stakeholders to identify and define key metrics that directly align with business goals.
- Ensure that KPIs are specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART).
- Establish a KPI hierarchy, distinguishing between strategic, tactical, and operational metrics.

## 5. Determine Data Sources

- Compile a comprehensive list of internal and external data sources that contribute to the BI requirements.
- Evaluate the accessibility and quality of each data source to ensure it meets the standards required for effective analysis.
- Consider the integration of structured and unstructured data for a holistic view.

## 6. Assess Data Quality

- Implement a data profiling process to assess the quality of data, identifying issues related to accuracy, completeness, consistency, and timeliness.
- Develop a strategy for data cleansing and transformation to address any identified quality issues.
- Establish ongoing data quality monitoring practices to maintain high standards.

## 7. Define User Roles and Responsibilities

- Clearly define user roles such as executives, analysts, and operational staff, outlining their responsibilities within the BI system.
- Determine access levels and permissions based on user roles to ensure data security and privacy.
- Establish a feedback loop for users to provide insights on system usability and functionality.

## 8. Create a Data Governance Plan

- Develop data governance policies covering data security, privacy, compliance, and ethical use.
- Assign roles and responsibilities for data stewardship, data ownership, and data custodianship.
- Implement procedures for data classification, access control, and audit trails to maintain data integrity.

## 9. Design Information Delivery

- Choose appropriate visualization techniques for different types of data and audiences.
- Determine the frequency and format of information delivery, considering scheduled reports, real-time dashboards, and ad-hoc queries.
- Design user-friendly interfaces to facilitate easy interpretation and interaction with BI insights.

## 10. Select BI Tools and Technologies

- Evaluate BI tools and technologies based on factors such as scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities, and cost.
- Consider the compatibility of selected tools with existing infrastructure and technologies.
- Ensure that the chosen tools support the required analytics and reporting features.

## 11. Develop Prototypes

- Create interactive prototypes of reports and dashboards to gather user feedback early in the development process.
- Iteratively refine prototypes based on stakeholder input, ensuring alignment with user expectations.
- Use prototyping as a tool for validating data visualizations and user workflows.

## 12. Implement BI Solution

- Develop the BI solution based on the finalized requirements, adhering to best practices in coding and development.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and address any bugs or issues.
- Collaborate with IT and relevant departments for a seamless integration process.

## 13. User Training and Adoption

- Develop a comprehensive training program for users at all levels, focusing on tool functionality, data interpretation, and decision-making.
- Provide user documentation and support resources for ongoing learning.
- Encourage user adoption through workshops, tutorials, and incentives.

## 14. Monitor and Evaluate

- Implement continuous monitoring of BI system performance, including data refresh rates, response times, and system availability.
- Gather regular feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
- Establish key metrics for evaluating the overall impact of the BI system on business objectives.

## 15. Iterate and Improve

- Regularly review and update the BI system based on evolving business needs and technological advancements.
- Conduct periodic assessments of user satisfaction and system performance.
- Implement agile development practices to quickly respond to changing requirements.
